# Programming Optimization and Metaheuristics

This repository contains a collection of optimization problems and their solutions using **Pyomo** and various **metaheuristic algorithms**. The repository covers different types of optimization problems such as:

- **Linear Programming (LP)**
- **Nonlinear Programming (NLP)**
- **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)**
- **Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP)**
- **Metaheuristic Algorithms** (Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, etc.)

## Overview

Optimization is a crucial part of solving real-world problems across various domains, including supply chain management, financial planning, machine learning, and engineering. This repository demonstrates how to solve optimization problems using the powerful **Pyomo** modeling framework and explore the use of metaheuristics for complex, large-scale problems.

### Key Features:

- **Pyomo**: A Python-based optimization modeling language for formulating and solving linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer optimization problems.
- **Metaheuristics**: A collection of algorithms inspired by nature and evolution, such as Genetic Algorithms (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), and more.
- **Solvers**: Integration with several solvers like CBC, Gurobi, CPLEX, IPOPT, and others for solving the formulated models.
